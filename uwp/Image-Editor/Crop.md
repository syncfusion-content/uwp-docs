# Cropping the image with various aspect ratios

The image editor control gives you an option to crop the image as desired. Cropping the image can be done in following two ways:

* From Toolbar
* Cropping programmatically

### From Toolbar

To enable cropping, in the `Transforms` submenu, click the `Crop` icon. When the `Crop` icon is tapped, a sub toolbar will appear on top of that toolbar. While the cropping is enabled, the crop sub toolbar, `Cancel` and `OK` buttons will be available. From that sub toolbar, you can able to crop the image with the following aspect ratios.

* `Free`- crop the image to any desired size.
* `Original`-crop the image based on image width and height. 
* `Square`-crop the image based on equal width and height.
* Crop the image to specific aspect ratio such as `3:1, 1:3, 3:2, 2:3, 4:3, 3:4, 5:4, 4:5, 16:9, 9:16`. On double tapping the aspect ratio icon reversed ratio will shown. 

To disable cropping,click the `Cancel` button. To save the cropped area, after selected the desired area, Click the `OK` button, the toolbars will reappear after the cropping operation is completed.

### Cropping programmatically

Cropping operation can be done programmatically in following two ways:

* Enable Cropping and Select the Crop region visually.
* Manually set the cropping area.

#### Handling the cropping tool

The `ToggleCropping` method in the SfImageEditor control is used to enable and disable a cropping region placed over the image to visually choose the area for cropping. 

*	To crop the image to any desired size.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

//  for free hand cropping

imageEditor.ToggleCropping();    

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

* To crop an image based on original width and height of the image.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

// for cropping the image with original width and height of the image.

imageEditor.ToggleCropping(float.NaN,float.NaN);    

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

* To crop an image as square dimension.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

// for cropping the image in square format.

imageEditor.ToggleCropping(1, 1);    

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

* To crop an image based on specific ratio.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

// for cropping the image with ratio x value as 9 and y value as 17

imageEditor.ToggleCropping(9,17);    

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

* To position the cropping window with custom location, pass the desired rectangle in ToggleCropping method. Each value in the rectangle should be in offset value(0 to 100).

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

Rect rect = new Rect(20,20,50,50);

editor.ToggleCropping(rect);    

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

After the cropping area has been selected, the `Crop` method is called which in turn crops the selected region and displays the cropped image on the ImageEditor.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

// After selecting the crop area visually

imageEditor.Crop(new Rect(0, 0, 0, 0));

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

### Circle cropping

An image can be cropped in circle or elliptical format, which could be perfect for using it as a profile picture.
Specify the [`ToggleCropping`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.ImageEditor.SfImageEditor.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_ImageEditor_SfImageEditor_ToggleCropping_Windows_Foundation_Rect_System_Boolean_) parameter as shown in the below code sample.

N> When an empty rect is specified in the parameter, a rounded rect will be formed covering the entire image and it will be either in circle or ellipse shape based on the image bounds.

{% highlight C# %}

// To crop an image as a circular dimension.

            var size = editor.ActualImageRenderedBounds;
            var minSize = Math.Min(size.Width, size.Height);
            var leftX = (size.Width - minSize) / 2;
            var topY = (size.Height - minSize) / 2;

            var x = (leftX * 100) / size.Width;
            var y = (topY * 100) / size.Height;
            var width = (minSize * 100) / size.Width;
            var height = (minSize * 100) / size.Height;

            editor.ToggleCropping(new Rect(x, y, width, height), true);

{% endhighlight %}

The following image show cases the circularly cropped image.

 The following code shows cropping an image in elliptical format.

{% highlight C# %}

// To crop an image as a elliptical dimension.

  editor.ToggleCropping(new Rect(), true);

{% endhighlight %}

## Manually set the cropping area

To manually set the cropping rectangle without even enabling the cropping functionality, use overloaded Crop(Rectangle rect) method. This can be done by defining a rectangle and pass it to Crop(rect) method.


{% highlight C# %}

    imageEditor.Crop(new Rect(200, 150, 150, 150));

{% endhighlight %}

### Selecting the cropping ratio programmatically

Programmatically, you can select the desired cropping ratio from the various aspect ratios available in the built-in cropping toolbar by specifying the corresponding index of the toolbar item using the [`ToggleCropping`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.ImageEditor.SfImageEditor.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_ImageEditor_SfImageEditor_ToggleCropping_System_Boolean_System_Int32_) method.

The following code sample will add the cropping preview on the image in square shape.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

 editor.ToggleCropping(true, 2);

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
