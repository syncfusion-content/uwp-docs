# Save edited image in SfImageEditor

The image can be saved along with the changes. Saving an image can be done in the following two ways:

* From Toolbar
* Using Code

## From Toolbar

To save an image from the toolbar, click the `Save` button in the top toolbar. The saved image will be added in default pictures library "C:\\Users\\your name\\Pictures\\Saved Pictures".

## Using Code

Programmatically, `Save` method can be used in the SfImageEditor control to save the image.


{% highlight C# %}

    imageEditor.Save();

{% endhighlight %}


## Events

The SfImageEditor has Events namely, [`ImageSaving`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/sfimageeditor) and [`ImageSaved`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/sfimageeditor).

## ImageSaving

This event occurs before saving the image. Described the ImageSaving event arguments below.

`Cancel` : You can control the save functionality using the `Cancel` argument.

It restricts saving image to the default location when set `Cancel` value to `true`.

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight C# %}
           
  		    private void SfImageEditor_ImageSaving(object sender, Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.ImageEditor.ImageSavingEventArgs args)
            {
                args.Cancel = true;  
            }

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

            {
                var stream = args.Stream;
            }

{% endhighlight %}

          {
             args.FileName = "SavedImage";
          }

{% endhighlight %}

## ImageSaved

This event occurs after the image has been saved. To get the location of the saved image, use the `Location` argument as shown below,
