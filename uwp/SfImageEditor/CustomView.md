## Adding custom view

 You can add any custom shape or view to an image using the `AddCustomView` method in the image editor
 control. To add a custom view, specify the view and its desired `CustomViewSettings` as demonstrated in the 
 following code snippet.

{% highlight C# %}

            Image customImage = new Image() { Height = 100, Width = 100 };
            customImage.Source = new BitmapImage(new Uri("ms-appx:///customImage.png"));
            imageEditor.AddCustomView(customImage, new CustomViewSettings());

{% endhighlight %}

## Custom view settings

The `CustomViewSettings` is defined to set values for the `CanMaintainAspectRatio`, `Bounds`, and `Angle` properties.

* The CanMaintainAspectRatio property is used to decide whether the aspect ratio value needs to be maintained when resizing the custom view.

* Bounds property is used to set the boundaries of the custom view. Using this property, you can position the custom view wherever you want on the image. In percentage, the value should fall between 0 and 100.

* Angle property is used to set the angle for custom view. Using this property, you can rotate the custom view to the desired angle.

{% highlight C# %}

            CustomViewSettings customViewSettings = new CustomViewSettings()
            {
                CanMaintainAspectRatio = false,
                Bounds = new Rect(30, 30, 30, 30)
            };

{% endhighlight %}

## Custom view rotation

You can rotate and resize the custom view by enabling the `RotatableElements` property of image editor. `ImageEditorElements` is an enum type with values Text, CustomView and None as demonstrated in the following code snippet.

{% highlight C# %}

        imageEditor.RotatableElements = Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.ImageEditor.Enums.ImageEditorElements.CustomView;

{% endhighlight %}

>Note: The default value for RotatableElements is `None`.

You can rotate the custom view based on a particular angle using `Angle` property in `CustomViewSettings` as demonstrated in the following code snippet. 

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

        imageEditor.AddCustomView(customImage, new CustomViewSettings(){Angle = 45});    

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
