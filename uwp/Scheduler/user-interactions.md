# User Interactions in UWP Scheduler (SfSchedule)

## Change the default context menu
When tapping on the schedule or appointment, our built-in context menu will be opened and triggering [ContextMenuOpening](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ContextMenuOpeningEventArgs.html) event. You can create your own context menu by setting `e.Cancel` to true in the `ContextMenuOpening` event. It will avoid to open the default context menu. 


{% highlight c# %} 

        schedule.ContextMenuOpening += Schedule_ContextMenuOpening;
        private void Schedule_ContextMenuOpening(object sender,ContextMenuOpeningEventArgs e)
        {
            e.Cancel = true;
        }

{% endhighlight %}   


## Change the default editor
[AppointmentEditorOpening](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs.html) event occurs when opening the appointment editor by selecting edit option in the context menu or double tapping the appointment. You can create your own appointment editor by setting `e.Cancel` to true in the `AppointmentEditorOpening` event. It will avoid to open the default editor. 

{% highlight c# %} 

      schedule.AppointmentEditorOpening += Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening;
      private void Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening(object sender,AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs e)
        {
            e.Cancel = true;
        }
