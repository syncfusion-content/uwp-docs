# Appointments in UWP Scheduler (SfSchedule)

[SfSchedule](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/sfschedule) control has a built-in capability to handle the appointment arrangement internally based on the [ScheduleAppointmentCollection](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentCollection.html). [ScheduleAppointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointment.html) is a class, which holds the details about the appointment to be rendered in schedule.

{% highlight c# %}

    // Creating an instance for schedule appointment collection
            ScheduleAppointmentCollection scheduleAppointmentCollection = new ScheduleAppointmentCollection();
            //Adding schedule appointment in schedule appointment collection 
            scheduleAppointmentCollection.Add(new ScheduleAppointment()
            {
                StartTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(10),
                EndTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(12),
                Subject = "Meeting",
                Location = "Hutchison road",
            });
            //Adding schedule appointment collection to SfSchedule DataSource
            schedule.Appointments = scheduleAppointmentCollection;
{% endhighlight %}

N> CustomAppointment class should contain two DateTime fields and a string field as mandatory.

### Creating custom Appointments
You can create a custom class `Meeting` with mandatory fields `From`, `To` and `EventName`.
{% highlight c# %}

        /// <summary>   
        /// Represents custom data properties.   
        /// </summary>   

    public class Meeting
    {
        public string EventName { get; set; }
        public DateTime From { get; set; }
        public DateTime To { get; set; }
        public Brush Color { get; set; }
    }

{% endhighlight %}

N> You can inherit this class from `INotifyPropertyChanged` for dynamic changes in custom data.

You can map those properties of `Meeting` class with our SfSchedule control by using `ScheduleAppointmentMapping`.
{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

        // Schedule data mapping for custom appointments
            ScheduleAppointmentMapping dataMapping = new ScheduleAppointmentMapping();
            dataMapping.SubjectMapping = "EventName";
            dataMapping.StartTimeMapping = "From";
            dataMapping.EndTimeMapping = "To";
            dataMapping.AppointmentBackgroundMapping = "Color";
            schedule.AppointmentMapping = dataMapping;

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight xaml %} 
 
    <syncfusion:SfSchedule x:Name="schedule" ScheduleType="Week" ItemsSource="{Binding Meetings}">
            <syncfusion:SfSchedule.AppointmentMapping>
                <syncfusion:ScheduleAppointmentMapping
                    SubjectMapping="EventName" 
                    AppointmentBackgroundMapping="Color"
                    StartTimeMapping="From"
                    EndTimeMapping="To">
                </syncfusion:ScheduleAppointmentMapping>
            </syncfusion:SfSchedule.AppointmentMapping>
        </syncfusion:SfSchedule>
 
{% endhighlight %} 
{% endtabs %} 

You can schedule meetings for a day by setting `From` and `To` of `Meeting` class. Create meetings of type `ObservableCollection <Meeting>` and assign those appointments collection `Meetings` to the `ItemsSource` property which is of `IEnumerable` type.

{% highlight c# %}

            // Creating instance for custom appointment class
            Meeting meeting = new Meeting();
            // Setting start time of an event
            meeting.From = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(10) ;
            // Setting end time of an event
            meeting.To = meeting.From.AddHours(1);
            // Setting start time for an event
            meeting.EventName = "Anniversary";
            // Setting color for an event
            meeting.Color = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green);
            // Creating instance for collection of custom appointments
           var  Meetings = new ObservableCollection<Meeting>();
            // Adding a custom appointment in CustomAppointmentCollection
            Meetings.Add(meeting);

           
            // Adding custom appointments in SfSchedule DataSource
            schedule.ItemsSource = Meetings;

{% endhighlight %} 

![UWP SfSchedule displays applying color in scheduled time](Appointments_images/custom.png)

N> You can get the Custom appointment in `ScheduleTappedEventArgs` of `ScheduleTapped` event in Recurrence appointment.

{% highlight c# %}

schedule.ScheduleTapped += Schedule_ScheduleTapped;
private void Schedule_ScheduleTapped(object sender, ScheduleTappedEventArgs e)
{
    var appointment = e.Appointment as Meeting;
}

{% endhighlight %} 

## Spanned Appointments
Spanned Appointment is an appointment which lasts more than 24 hours.

{% highlight c# %}

            // Creating instance for custom appointment class
            Meeting meeting = new Meeting();
            // Setting start time of an event
            meeting.From = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(10) ;
            // Setting end time of an event
            meeting.To = meeting.From.AddDays(2).AddHours(1);
            // Setting start time for an event
            meeting.EventName = "Anniversary";
            // Setting color for an event
            meeting.Color = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green);
            // Creating instance for collection of custom appointments
           var  Meetings = new ObservableCollection<Meeting>();
            // Adding a custom appointment in CustomAppointmentCollection
            Meetings.Add(meeting);

{% endhighlight %} 

![UWP SfSchedule displays applied colors in all scheduled date](Appointments_images/span.png)

## All Day Appointments
All-Day appointment is an appointment which is scheduled for a whole day. It can be set by using `IsAllDay` property in the `ScheduleAppointment`.

{% highlight c# %}

        // Creating an instance for schedule appointment collection
            ScheduleAppointmentCollection scheduleAppointmentCollection = new ScheduleAppointmentCollection();
            //Adding schedule appointment in schedule appointment collection 
            scheduleAppointmentCollection.Add(new ScheduleAppointment()
            {
                StartTime = new DateTime(2017, 05, 08, 10, 0, 0),
                EndTime = new DateTime(2017, 05, 10, 12, 0, 0),
                Subject = "Meeting",
                Location = "Hutchison road",
                AllDay = true
            });
            //Adding schedule appointment collection to DataSource of SfSchedule
            schedule.Appointments = scheduleAppointmentCollection;

{% endhighlight %} 

### All-Day Appointment Panel
All-day appointment doesn't block out entire time slot in SfSchedule, rather it will render in separate layout exclusively for all-day appointment. It can be enabled by setting `ShowAllDay` property of `SfSchedule`.

{% highlight c# %}

            schedule.ShowAllDay = true; 

{% endhighlight %} 

All-Day panel background can be customized by setting `AllDayAppointmentPanelBrush` 
of the respective view settings.

{% highlight c# %}

         schedule.AllDayAppointmentPanelBrush = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green); 

{% endhighlight %} 

![UWP SfSchedule displays all day appointment](Appointments_images/allday.png)

## Recurrence Appointment
Recurring an appointment on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly interval. Recursive appointments can be created by enabling `IsRecursive` property in Schedule appointments. 

### Recurrence Pattern
Recurrence pattern used in the control are in iCal standard. Schedule control supports all four types of [recurrence patterns](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.RecurrenceProperties.html).

### Adding Recurrence Appointment using Recurrence Builder
Schedule appointment [RecurrenceRule](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleAppointment_RecurrenceRuleProperty) is used to populate the required recursive appointment collection in a specific pattern. `RRULE` can be easily created through `RecurrenceBuilder` engine by simple APIs available in Schedule control.

{% highlight c# %}

   
                // Creating an instance for schedule appointment collection
            ScheduleAppointmentCollection scheduleAppointmentCollection = new ScheduleAppointmentCollection();
            //Adding schedule appointment in schedule appointment collection 
            var scheduleAppointment = new ScheduleAppointment()
            {
                StartTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(10),
                EndTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(12),
                Subject = "Occurs every alternate day",
                IsRecursive = true
            };

            //Adding schedule appointment in schedule appointment collection
            scheduleAppointmentCollection.Add(scheduleAppointment);

            // Creating recurrence rule
            RecurrenceProperties recurrenceProperties = new RecurrenceProperties();
            recurrenceProperties.RecurrenceType = RecurrenceType.Daily;
            recurrenceProperties.IsRangeRecurrenceCount = true;
            recurrenceProperties.DailyNDays = 2;
            recurrenceProperties.IsDailyEveryNDays = true;
            recurrenceProperties.IsWeeklySunday = false;
            recurrenceProperties.IsWeeklyMonday = true;
            recurrenceProperties.IsWeeklyTuesday = false;
            recurrenceProperties.IsWeeklyWednesday = false;
            recurrenceProperties.IsWeeklyThursday = false;
            recurrenceProperties.IsWeeklyFriday = false;
            recurrenceProperties.IsWeeklySaturday = false;
            recurrenceProperties.RangeRecurrenceCount = 10;
            recurrenceProperties.RecurrenceRule = ScheduleHelper.RRuleGenerator(recurrenceProperties, scheduleAppointment.StartTime, scheduleAppointment.EndTime);

            // Setting recurrence rule to schedule appointment
            scheduleAppointment.RecurrenceRule = recurrenceProperties.RecurrenceRule;

            //Adding schedule appointment collection to SfSchedule DataSource
            schedule.Appointments = scheduleAppointmentCollection

{% endhighlight %} 

![UWP SfSchedule displays appointment in each two days](Appointments_images/recurrence.png)

## Setting reminders
Schedule reminds you the appointment in the specified time by setting the EnableReminderTimer property is true. The remainder time can be set using the [ReminderTime](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointment.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleAppointment_ReminderTimeProperty) property of `ScheduleAppointment`.

N> Open package.appxmanifest file to the Application UI tab and select “Yes” from the “Toast capable” dropdown list to enable toast notifications in your application manifest.

{% highlight c# %}

                schedule.EnableReminderTimer = true;
            schedule.Appointments.Add(new ScheduleAppointment
            {
                StartTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(9),
                EndTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(12),
                AppointmentBackground = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromArgb(0xFf, 0xA2, 0xC1, 0x39)),
                Subject = "Business Meeting",
                ReminderTime = ReminderTimeType.TenHours
            });
            schedule.Appointments.Add(new ScheduleAppointment
            {
                StartTime = currentDate.Date.AddDays(1).AddHours(10),
                EndTime = currentDate.Date.AddDays(1).AddHours(16),
                AppointmentBackground = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromArgb(0xFf, 0xD8, 0x00, 0x73)),
                Subject = "Auditing",
                ReminderTime = ReminderTimeType.TwoDays
            });
            schedule.Appointments.Add(new ScheduleAppointment
            {
                StartTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddDays(7).AddHours(10),
                EndTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddDays(7).AddHours(13),
                AppointmentBackground = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromArgb(0xFf, 0xF0, 0x96, 0x09)),
                Subject = "Conference",
                ReminderTime = ReminderTimeType.TwoWeeks
            });

{% endhighlight %}

## Editing appointment
The existing appointment can be edited by using the following ways.

•	Using Editor
•	Using Context menu

### Using Editor
To edit the existing appointment, we need to double click on corresponding appointment and modify the existing data of selected appointment by using the editor displayed.

### Using Context menu
The user can also use the Context menu to edit the selected appointment by selecting the Edit option in menu item, which opens the default editor of the schedule control.


## Appearance Customization
The default appearance of the appointment can be customized by using the [ScheduleAppointmentStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle.html) property and [ScheduleAppointmentLoaded](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentLoadedEventArgs.html). The event and property is used to customize or override the default template of the Appointments.

•	[Customize appearance using Style](https://help.syncfusion.com/uwp/sfschedule/appointments#customize-appearance-using-style) 
•	[Customize appearance using Event](https://help.syncfusion.com/uwp/sfschedule/appointments#customize-appearance-using-event)
•	[Customize appearance using Custom View](https://help.syncfusion.com/uwp/sfschedule/appointments#customize-appearance-using-custom-view)

### Customize appearance using Style
Schedule appointment can be customized by setting appointment style properties such as [AppointmentTextColor](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentStyle_AppointmentTextColorProperty), [AppointmentFontStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentStyle_AppointmentFontStyleProperty), [BorderColor](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentStyle_BorderColorProperty), [BorderCornerRadius](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentStyle_BorderCornerRadiusProperty), [BorderThickness](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentStyle_BorderThicknessProperty) to the `ScheduleAppointmentStyle` property of `SfSchedule`.

{% highlight c# %}

                //Creating Appointment style 
            ScheduleAppointmentStyle appointmentStyle = new ScheduleAppointmentStyle();
            appointmentStyle.AppointmentTextColor = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Red);
            appointmentStyle.AppointmentFontStyle = Windows.UI.Text.FontStyle.Italic;
            appointmentStyle.BorderColor = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Blue);
            appointmentStyle.BorderCornerRadius = new CornerRadius(5);
            appointmentStyle.BorderThickness = new Thickness(5);

            //Setting Appointment Style 
            schedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle = appointmentStyle; 

{% endhighlight %}

![UWP SfSchedule displays editing the appointment details](Appointments_images/style.png)

### Customize appearance using Event
Schedule appointment can be customized during runtime using [ScheduleAppointmentLoadedEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentLoadedEventArgs.html). `ScheduleAppointment` style can be customized using the `ScheduleAppointmentStyle` property.

[ScheduleAppointmentLoadedEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentLoadedEventArgs.html) has below properties,

•	[ScheduleAppointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentLoadedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentLoadedEventArgs_ScheduleAppointment) – Contains the appointments values.
•	[ScheduleAppointmentStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentLoadedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentLoadedEventArgs_ScheduleAppointmentStyle) – Gets and sets the appointments style.

           schedule.ScheduleAppointmentLoaded += Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentLoaded;

     private void Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentLoaded(object sender, ScheduleAppointmentLoadedEventArgs args)
    {
        if (args.ScheduleAppointment != null && (args.ScheduleAppointment).Subject == "Meeting")
        {
            args.ScheduleAppointmentStyle.BorderColor = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Blue);
            args.ScheduleAppointmentStyle.BorderCornerRadius = new CornerRadius(5);
            args.ScheduleAppointmentStyle.BorderThickness = new Thickness(5);
        }
    }

 
{% endhighlight %}

## Customize appearance using Custom View
Default appointment UI can be changed using `View` property passed through `AppointmentLoadedEventArgs`.

{% highlight c# %} 
 
     schedule.ScheduleAppointmentLoaded += Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentLoaded;

         private void Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentLoaded(object sender, ScheduleAppointmentLoadedEventArgs args)
        {
                Button button = new Button();
                button.Background = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green);
                if (args.ScheduleAppointment != null)
                    button.Content = (args.ScheduleAppointment).Subject;
                args.View = button;
        }

 
{% endhighlight %}

## Selection
Schedule control has built-in events to handle tapped and double tapped touch actions.

•	[ScheduleTapped](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleTappedEventArgs.html)
•	[ScheduleDoubleTapped](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleTappedEventArgs.html)

These events will be triggered while perform respective touch actions in timeslots, month cells and in appointments. These events contain the same argument [ScheduleTappedEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleTappedEventArgs.html) which holds selected appointment and date time details in it.

• [Appointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleTappedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleTappedEventArgs_Appointment) -  Contains the selected appointment value, it will be null, if any time slots selected.
• [SelectedDate](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleTappedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleTappedEventArgs_SelectedDate) - Contains selected time slot DateTime value.
• [SelectedResource](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleTappedEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleTappedEventArgs_SelectedResource) - Contains selected time slot DateTime value.

{% highlight c# %} 
 
     schedule.ScheduleTapped += Schedule_ScheduleTapped;
     schedule.ScheduleDoubleTapped += Schedule_ScheduleDoubleTapped;


    private void Schedule_ScheduleDoubleTapped(object sender, ScheduleTappedEventArgs e)
    {
    }

    private void Schedule_ScheduleTapped(object sender, ScheduleTappedEventArgs e)
    { 
    }
 
{% endhighlight %}

### Selection customization
The default selection of an appointment can be customized by using [SelectionColor](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentStyle_SelectionColorProperty), [SelectionTextColor](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Schedule_ScheduleAppointmentStyle_SelectionTextColorProperty) properties in `ScheduleAppointmentStyle` property of `SfSchedule`. The property is used to customize or override the default selection of the appointments.

N> `BorderWidth` value must be set to highlight `SelectionColor`.

{% tabs %} 
{% highlight c# %} 
 
            //Creating Appointment style 
        ScheduleAppointmentStyle appointmentStyle = new ScheduleAppointmentStyle();
        appointmentStyle.SelectionColor = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Yellow);
        appointmentStyle.SelectionTextColor = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Yellow);

            //Setting Appointment Style 
        schedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle = appointmentStyle;
 
{% endhighlight %}
  
{% highlight xaml %} 
 
     <syncfusion:SfSchedule x:Name="schedule" ScheduleType="Week" >
            <syncfusion:SfSchedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle>
                <syncfusion:ScheduleAppointmentStyle BorderThickness="10" 
            SelectionColor="Yellow" 
            BorderCornerRadius="10" 
            SelectionTextColor="Yellow">
                </syncfusion:ScheduleAppointmentStyle>
            </syncfusion:SfSchedule.ScheduleAppointmentStyle>
        </syncfusion:SfSchedule>
 
{% endhighlight %} 
{% endtabs %}

## Configuring resources
The Schedule control allows you to define resources that can be assigned to appointments. [Resources](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/uwp/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Schedule.Resource.html) let you associate additional information with your appointments. The schedule can group appointments based on the resources associated with them.

{% highlight c# %} 
 
        //creating appointments for resource
    ScheduleAppointment ScheduleAppointment = new ScheduleAppointment() 
    {                
        StartTime = currentDate, 
        EndTime = currentDate.AddHours(2), 
        Subject = "Meeting", 
        Location = "Chennai", 
        AppointmentBackground = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green) 
    };
    ScheduleAppointment.ResourceCollection.Add(new Resource() { ResourceName = "Dr.Jacob", TypeName = "Doctor" });
    
    //creating appointments for resource
    ScheduleAppointment ScheduleAppointment1 = new ScheduleAppointment() 
    { 
        StartTime = currentDate.AddHours(4), 
        EndTime = currentDate.AddHours(2), 
        Subject = "Meeting", 
        Location = "Chennai", 
        AppointmentBackground = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green) 
    };
    ScheduleAppointment1.ResourceCollection.Add(new Resource() { ResourceName = "Dr.Darsy", TypeName = "Doctor" });

    //Adding schedule appointments
        schedule.Appointments.Add(ScheduleAppointment);
        schedule.Appointments.Add(ScheduleAppointment1);
 
{% endhighlight %}
