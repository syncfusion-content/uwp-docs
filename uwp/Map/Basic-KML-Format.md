# Basic KML Format in UWP Map (SfMaps)

KML is a file format used for rendering geographical data. It uses a tag-based structure with nested elements and attributes. KML is based on the XML standard, and all tags of a KML file are case-sensitive.

Currently, the SfMaps control supports the following KML elements:

* Place mark
* Point
* LinearRing
* Polygon
* MultiGeometry
* Region
* Style
* StyleMap
* BalloonStyle
* LineStyle
* PolyStyle
* IconStyle
* ExtendedData
