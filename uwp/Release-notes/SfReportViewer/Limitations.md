# Limitations

## RDL Specification support

* The ReportViewer control does not support RDL Specification for SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005.

## Layout process

* The Syncfusion ReportViewer control has some limitations in the Tablix cell split layout process in comparison with MS ReportViewer. When the table cell width value exceeds the page width, the entire cell moves to the next page to display the complete cell items. 

## Unsupported expression

* The object function and VB function do not have complete support in the ReportViewer.
