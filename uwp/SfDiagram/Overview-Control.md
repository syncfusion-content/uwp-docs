# Overview Control

Overview control is used to display a preview (overall view) of the entire content of a Diagram. This helps you to look overall picture of large Diagram and also to navigate (pan or zoom) to a particular position of the page.

When you work on a very large Diagram, You may not know the part where you are actually working or navigation from one part to another might be a difficult. To navigation, you can zoom out entire Diagram and find where you are. This solution is not suitable when you need some frequent navigation.

Note : 

Supported platform: WPF, WinRT 8.1, Universal, UWP
