## Alignment Commands

Alignment commands enable you to align the selected objects such as Nodes and Connectors on a page with respect to a reference object.

The Alignment commands as follows

| Commands | Description |
|---|---|---|
| AlignLeft | The AlignLeft command enables you to align all selected objects along the left corner of the reference object. |
| AlignRight | The AlignRight command enables you to align all selected objects along the right corner of the reference object. |
| AlignCenter | The AlignCenter command enables you to center all selected objects vertically. It aligns selected objects to the center with respect to the horizontal axis by changing the x-coordinate of the object. |
| AlignTop | The AlignTop command enables you to align all selected objects along the top surface of the reference object. |
| AlignBottom | The AlignBottom command enables you to align all selected objects along the bottom surface of the reference object. |
| AlignMiddle | The AlignMiddle command enables you to center all selected objects horizontally. It aligns selected objects to the center with respect to the vertical axis by changing the y-coordinate of the object. |

The following code example illustrates how to align all the selected objects at the left side of selection boundary.

{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;

// sets diration as left

graphinfo.Commands.AlignTop.Execute(null);

{% endhighlight %}

![AlignMiddle](Commands_images/Commands_img5.jpeg)
![AlignBottom](Commands_images/Commands_img6.jpeg)

## Spacing Commands

Spacing commands enable you to place selected objects on the page at equal intervals from each other. The objects are spaced within the bounds of the first and last objects in the selection.

The following code example illustrates how to execute the space commands.

{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;

// Equally spaces the selected nodes horizontally

graphinfo.Commands.SpaceAcross.Execute(null);

// Equally spaces the selected nodes vertically

graphinfo.Commands.SpaceDown.Execute(null);

{% endhighlight %}

## Sizing Commands

Object size commands enable selected Diagram objects on the page to be resized. The selected objects are resized in proportion to the first object in the selection list.

The following code example illustrates how to execute the size commands.

{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;

//Scales the selected items to the size of first selected object

graphinfo.Commands.SameSize.Execute(null);

//Vertically scales the selected items to the height of first selected object

graphinfo.Commands.SameHeight.Execute(null);

//Horizontally scales the selected items to the width of first selected object

graphinfo.Commands.SameWidth.Execute(null);

{% endhighlight %}

| Before | After |

{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;

//Cuts the selected elements from the Diagram to the Diagram’s clipboard

graphinfo.Commands.Cut.Execute(null);

//Copies the selected elements from the Diagram to the Diagram’s clipboard.

graphinfo.Commands.Copy.Execute(null);

//Pastes the Diagram’s clipboard data (nodes/connectors) into the Diagram.

graphinfo.Commands.Paste.Execute(null);

{% endhighlight %}

![Paste](Commands_images/Commands_img13.jpeg)

## Duplicate Command

This command copies the selected objects from the diagram and pastes the copied content into the diagram.                           

![Duplicate](Commands_images/Commands_img14.jpeg)

## Grouping Command

#### List of Commands and Mouse Gesture with Parameter

| Command | Scroll State | Parameter |
|---|---|---|
| Vertical Scroll using ‘Zoom’ command | Scroll | new ZoomPointerParameter { ZoomCommand = ZoomCommand.VerticalScroll} |

#### List of Commands and Key and Mouse Gesture with Parameter

| Command | KeyModifier | Scroll State | Parameter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Horizontal Scroll using ‘Zoom’ command | Shift | Scroll | new ZoomPointerParameter { ZoomCommand = ZoomCommand.HorizontalScroll} |
| Zoom | Control | Scroll | new ZoomPointerParameter { ZoomCommand = ZoomCommand.ZoomIn | ZoomCommand.ZoomOut} |

N> When different commands are registered for the same key / mouse gestures, you need to handle the command while execution.

### Custom command

User defined commands can also be created and mapped with existing gesture by using command manager. The following code example explains how to register mouse key gesture with Parameter to Save Command (Control + S)

#### Create a user defined command: Save command

{% highlight C# %}
//Create ICommand

private ICommand _save;

public ICommand Save
{
	get { return _save;}
	set { _save = value; }
}
        

//Initialize Command

Save = new DelegateCommand(OnSaveCommand);
         
// Execute Command

private async void OnSaveCommand(Object obj)
{
	var picker = new FileSavePicker();
  
       // set appropriate file types
              
       picker.FileTypeChoices.Add(".xaml", new List<String> {".xaml"});
       picker.DefaultFileExtension = ".xaml";
       Object parameter = (obj as IGestureParameter).Parameter;
       picker.SuggestedFileName = parameter.ToString();
       StorageFile file = await picker.PickSaveFileAsync();
       using (var fileStream = await file.OpenStreamForWriteAsync())
       {
		sfdiagram.Save(fileStream);
       }
  }
  {% endhighlight %}
  
#### Map and user defined command with key gesture:

Add new Commands to CommandManager - Ctrl + S -> Save
            
{% highlight C# %}			
sfdiagram.CommandManager.Commands.Add
(
	new GestureCommand()
	{
		Command = Save,
		Gesture = new Gesture
		{
			KeyModifiers = ModifierKeys.Control,
			KeyState = KeyStates.Down,
			Key = Key.S
		},

		// Parameter is the name of the file (.xaml)
		Parameter = "diagram"
	}
);
