# Working with magnification

Magnification of the PDF document can be done in multiple ways and the different ways are explained below. By default the viewer control supports ctrl+ mouse scroll to manipulate the magnification of the document. 

In all code snippets that follow, 'buffer' is the byte array read from the PDF file either using FileOpenPicker or from Assets folder, as illustrated in the [Viewing PDF](https://help.syncfusion.com/uwp/sfpdfviewer/concepts-and-features/viewing-pdf) section. 

**Setting Custom zoom**

The user is allowed to set custom magnification factor between 100 and 300 to magnify the document displayed. The following code illustrates the same.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
PdfLoadedDocument loadedDocument = new PdfLoadedDocument(buffer);
pdfViewer.LoadDocument(loadedDocument);
//Sets magnification value to 140%.
pdfViewer.ZoomTo(140);
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}
Dim loadedDocument As New PdfLoadedDocument(Buffer)
pdfViewer.LoadDocument(loadedDocument)
'Sets magnification value to 140%.
pdfViewer.ZoomTo(140)
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

**Getting current zoom factor**

The following code illustrates accessing zoom factor in which the document is displayed in the viewer.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
PdfLoadedDocument loadedDocument = new PdfLoadedDocument(buffer);
pdfViewer.LoadDocument(loadedDocument);
//Gets the current zoom value of PDF Viewer
int zoom = pdfViewer.Zoom;
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}
Dim loadedDocument As New PdfLoadedDocument(Buffer)
pdfViewer.LoadDocument(loadedDocument)
'Gets the current zoom value of PDF Viewer
Dim zoom As Integer = pdfViewer.Zoom
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

**Working with View Modes**

The SfPdfViewerControl supports the below three view modes for better viewing experience.

* FitWidth
* Normal
* OnePage

The below code explains how to set the view mode to FitWidth.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
PdfLoadedDocument loadedDocument = new PdfLoadedDocument(buffer);
pdfViewer.LoadDocument(loadedDocument);
// Sets the PDF Page View Mode to Fit Width. 
pdfViewer.ViewMode = PageViewMode.FitWidth;
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}
Dim loadedDocument As New PdfLoadedDocument(Buffer)
pdfViewer.LoadDocument(loadedDocument)
'Sets the PDF Page View Mode to Fit Width. 
pdfViewer.ViewMode = PageViewMode.FitWidth
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

The below code explains how to set the view mode to Normal.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
PdfLoadedDocument loadedDocument = new PdfLoadedDocument(buffer);
pdfViewer.LoadDocument(loadedDocument);
// Sets the PDF Page View Mode to Normal. 
pdfViewer.ViewMode = PageViewMode.Normal;
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}
Dim loadedDocument As New PdfLoadedDocument(Buffer)
pdfViewer.LoadDocument(loadedDocument)
'Sets the PDF Page View Mode to Normal. 
pdfViewer.ViewMode = PageViewMode.Normal
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
The below code explains how to set the view mode to OnePage.
{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
PdfLoadedDocument loadedDocument = new PdfLoadedDocument(buffer);
pdfViewer.LoadDocument(loadedDocument);
// Sets the PDF Page View Mode to Single Page View.
pdfViewer.ViewMode = PageViewMode.OnePage;
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}
Dim loadedDocument As New PdfLoadedDocument(Buffer)
pdfViewer.LoadDocument(loadedDocument)
'Sets the PDF Page View Mode to Single Page View.
pdfViewer.ViewMode = PageViewMode.OnePage
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

N> 
* In Desktop view, when the zoom value is reduced below 100 percentage, the view will be automatically changes to show the thumbnails for easier navigation.
* One page view mode is supported only in mobile view, where the view will be changed to Flip View for easier navigation.

## Set minimum zoom percentage for PDF Viewer

The PDF Viewer control allows you to set the minimum zoom percentage value for the PDF document being displayed. The following code example will set minimum zoom percentage of PDF Viewer instance to 30.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
pdfViewer.MinimumZoomPercentage = 30;
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}
pdfViewer.MinimumZoomPercentage = 30
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

N> The accepted minimum zoom percentage ranges from 10% to 100%. Values less than 10% will be taken as 10%. Likewise values greater than 100% will be taken as 100%. Default value is the zoom percentage at which a single page completely fits the view port of PdfViewer.
* This fit-page zoom percentage is computed at runtime.
