# How to upgrade from Trial version after purchasing a license?

To upgrade from trial version,
 
* If you are using Syncfusion controls from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=syncfusion), replace the currently used trial license key with a paid license key that can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website. Refer to [this](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-register-the-syncfusion-license-key) topic for more information regarding registering the license in the application.

N> Starting with 2022 Volume 1 v20.1.0.47, all Syncfusion customers (evaluators and paid customers) who use Syncfusion installers or nuget packages from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Syncfusion) must generate and register the corresponding platform and version license key in your projects.<br>
For more information, please see [this](https://help.syncfusion.com/uwp/licensing/licensing) help topic.
