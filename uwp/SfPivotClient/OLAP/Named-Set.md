# Named Set

SfPivotClient supports the binding of OLAP data along with named set records pre-defined in the Cube. Named set is a collection of tuples and members, which can be defined and saved as a part of the cube definition. Named set records reside inside the *Sets* folder, which is under a dimension element. These elements can be dragged to Columns or Rows or Filters axis of the Axis Element Builder. To make working with a lengthy, complex or commonly used expression easier, Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) lets you define a named set.

The Cube Dimension Browser displays the Dimensions, Measures and KPIs along with named sets, from the selected Cube inside a tree on the right. To visualize these members, you can drag the members to the Axis Element Builder.
