# Localization

Localization is the key feature to provide software solutions that are targeted at global users. The SfPivotClient allows users to localize the control to a specific locale and supports “resx” based localization.

You can use the following steps to localize the control:

* Translation.
* Resource file and file name conventions.
* Culture specification.

## Translation

The first step in localization is translating the strings that can be localized to the destination locale.

N> Localization key field should be same for all locales. Do not translate the key fields.

## Resource file and file name conventions

After translating the strings, perform the following steps in the application:

1. Right-click the project file to create a new folder in the project by selecting **Add > New Folder** and renaming the folder as “Resources”.

2. Then, right-click the **Resources** folder to create a new resource file by selecting **Add > New Item**.

N> The resource file name should be in the format “&lt;Culture Code&gt;.resx”.

3. Copy and paste the translated locale to the created resource file.

## Culture specification

You should specify the CurrentUICulture in the Application_Startup method of the App.xaml.cs file or in the constructor of the MainPage.xaml.cs file.

N> If you are specifying the current culture in the constructor of the mainPage, then ensure that the culture is specified before calling the InitializeComponent() method.

    Inherits Page
    Public Sub New()
        ApplicationLanguages.PrimaryLanguageOverride = "ar-AE"
        Me.InitializeComponent()
    End Sub
End Class

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

## RTL

The SfPivotClient provides RTL support to display the content from right to left direction by setting the `FlowDirection` property to **RightToLeft**.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight xaml %}

<pivotclient:SfPivotClient x:Name="PivotClient1" FlowDirection="RightToLeft"
                           ItemsSource="{Binding ProductSalesData}" PivotColumns="{Binding PivotColumns}"
                           PivotRows="{Binding PivotRows}" PivotCalculations="{Binding PivotCalculations}"/>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight C# %}

PivotClient1.FlowDirection = FlowDirection.RightToLeft;

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

PivotClient1.FlowDirection = FlowDirection.RightToLeft

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
