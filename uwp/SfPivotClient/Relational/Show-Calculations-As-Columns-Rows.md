# Show Calculations as Columns or Rows

SfPivotClient provides support to show the calculation values as either columns or rows by using the property of `ShowCalculationsAsColumns`. By default, its value is true. In-order to view the calculation values in row, it should be set as false.

There are two ways to enable or disable this feature such as illustrated below.

**Using Code**

The calculations can be displayed as either columns or rows by setting the "ShowCalculationsAsColumns" property of SfPivotClient.

Please refer the below code snippet to display the calculations as column.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight xaml %}

<syncfusion:SfPivotClient x:Name="pivotClient" ShowCalculationsAsColumns="True" />

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight C# %}

this.pivotClient.ShowCalculationsAsColumns = true;

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

Me.pivotClient.ShowCalculationsAsColumns = True

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

## Using Pivot Table Field List

You can enable or disable this support by using the "Show Calculations as Column‚Äù check box available in PivotTableFieldList.
