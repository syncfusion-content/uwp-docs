* You can define the **Field Name** for the expression field.

* You can define the expression based on existing calculation items and numerical operators using the **Expression** field.

* You can define the format for the required field by using the **Format String** field. For example, 'C' for Currency, 'P' for Percentage, and 'N' for Numeric.

* You can change the summary type value by using the **Summary Type** drop-down. The default value of summary type is 'Count'.
