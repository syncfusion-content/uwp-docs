# Appointments

## Creating Appointments

SfSchedule appointments can be added to the SfSchedule control by using the following ways.

They are:

* Using Appointments Property 
* Using Data Binding Technique
* Using Appointment Editor
* Using Context Menu
* Using Schedule Command

### Using Appointments Property

You can add appointments directly to the Schedule control, by creating ScheduleAppointment collection and assigning it to Appointments property. 

{% highlight c# %}

           SfSchedule schedule = new SfSchedule();
           schedule.Appointments.Add(new ScheduleAppointment()
            {
                StartTime = new DateTime(2013, 6, 5, 5, 0, 0),
                EndTime = new DateTime(2013, 6, 5, 5, 30, 0),
                Subject = "Meet the doc",
                Location = "Hutchison road",
                AllDay = false
            });

{% endhighlight %}

### Using Data Binding Technique

Schedule supports full data binding to any type of IEnumerable source. Specify the **AppointmentMapping** attributes to map the properties in the underlying data source to the Schedule appointments. The basic attributes of the AppointmentMapping property are as follows.  

* Subject
* Location 
* StartTime 
* EndTime  

Add IEnumerable collection to schedule by using the **ItemsSource** property.  

{% tabs %}
{% highlight xaml %}

        <Schedule:SfSchedule Name="schedule" ScheduleType="Day" ItemsSource="{Binding MappedAppointments}">
            <Schedule:SfSchedule.AppointmentMapping>
                <Schedule:ScheduleAppointmentMapping
                    SubjectMapping="MappedSubject"
                    StartTimeMapping="MappedStartTime"
                    EndTimeMapping="MappedEndTime"/>
            </Schedule:SfSchedule.AppointmentMapping>
        </Schedule:SfSchedule>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# %}

    public partial class MainWindow : Window
    {
        public ObservableCollection<MappedAppointment> MappedAppointments { get; set;}
        public MainWindow()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            MappedAppointments = new ObservableCollection<MappedAppointment>
                     {
                         new MappedAppointment{MappedSubject = "Meeting", MappedStartTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(10), 
                                                 MappedEndTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(11)},
                         new MappedAppointment{MappedSubject = "Conference", MappedStartTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(15), 
                                                 MappedEndTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(16)},
                     };
            this.DataContext = this;
        }
    }

    public class MappedAppointment
    {
        public string MappedSubject { get; set; }
        public DateTime MappedStartTime { get; set; }
        public DateTime MappedEndTime { get; set; }
    }

## Appointment Time Zone

In Schedule, appointments can be created at various time zones using the properties StartTimeZone and EndTimeZone of the ScheduleAppointment. The default Start and End TimeZone value of schedule appointments is local time zone. Appointments will be arranged based on its Time Zone value.

{% highlight c# %}

             SfSchedule schedule = new SfSchedule();
            schedule.Appointments.Add(
            new ScheduleAppointment
             {
                 Subject = "Recurrence Appointment",
                 StartTimeZone = new TimeZone { TimeZoneValue = "(UTC+05:30) Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi" },
                 EndTimeZone = new TimeZone { TimeZoneValue = "(UTC+05:30) Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi" },
                 StartTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 5, 5, 0, 0),
                 EndTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 5, 5, 30, 0),

             });
            this.grid.Children.Add(schedule);

{% endhighlight %}

### TimeZoneCollection

The TimeZoneCollection property contains all the basic Time Zones in it and so it can be used to specify the start and end TimeZone value of the appointment in Schedule.

{% highlight c# %}

      SfSchedule schedule = new SfSchedule();
            schedule.Appointments.Add(new ScheduleAppointment()
            {
                StartTimeZone = schedule.TimeZoneCollection[2],
                EndTimeZone = schedule.TimeZoneCollection[2],
                StartTime = new DateTime(2013, 6, 5, 5, 0, 0),
                EndTime = new DateTime(2013, 6, 5, 5, 30, 0),
                Subject = "Meet the doc",
                Location = "Hutchison road",
                AllDay = false
            });

{% endhighlight %}

## All Day Appointments

You can create all day event by setting **AllDay** property of ScheduleAppointment as true. By default **AllDay** property value is false.

{% highlight c# %}

           SfSchedule schedule = new SfSchedule();
            this.schedule.Appointments.Add(new ScheduleAppointment
            {
                Subject = "Birthday",
                StartTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(1),
                EndTime = DateTime.Now.Date.AddHours(2),
                AllDay = true,
            });
            this.grid.Children.Add(schedule);
            
{% endhighlight %}

### Displaying /Hiding All-Day Panel 

All-Day event will be arranged in all day panel of SfSchedule. The schedule All Day panel visibility can be enabled or disabled by using **ShowAllDay** property and its default value is true.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight xaml %}

    <Schedule:SfSchedule x:Name="schedule" ShowAllDay="False"/>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# %}

            SfSchedule schedule = new SfSchedule();
            schedule.ShowAllDay = false;
            this.grid.Children.Add(schedule);

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

![](Appointments_images/Appointments_img12.jpeg)

## Read Only Appointments

By enabling the **ReadOnly** property of ScheduleAppointment you can restrict the user from editing the details of a specific appointment, you could not edit/delete the appointment defined as **ReadOnly** using UI in schedule control.

{% highlight c# %}

            SfSchedule schedule = new SfSchedule();
            schedule.ScheduleType = ScheduleType.Week;
            schedule.Appointments.Add(new ScheduleAppointment
            {
                Subject = "Read-Only",
                StartTime = date,
                EndTime = date.AddHours(2),
                ReadOnly = true
            });    
            this.grid.Children.Add(schedule);

{% endhighlight %}

![](Appointments_images/Appointments_img13.jpeg)

##  Appointment Status

You can declare the Appointment status based on its priority. Schedule Appointment status can be set by using the Status Property of the **ScheduleAppointment** and appointment status color can be differed by using **Brush** property.

{% highlight c# %}

            SfSchedule schedule = new SfSchedule();
            schedule.ScheduleType = ScheduleType.Week;
            schedule.Appointments.Add(new ScheduleAppointment()
            {
                Status = new ScheduleAppointmentStatus() { Brush = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green), Status = "Free" },
                StartTime = new DateTime(2013, 6, 5, 5, 0, 0),
                EndTime = new DateTime(2013, 6, 5, 5, 30, 0),
                Subject = "Meet the doc",
                Location = "Hutchison road",
                AllDay = false
            });

{% endhighlight %}

![](Appointments_images/Appointments_img14.jpeg)

### AppointmentStatusCollection:

The AppointmentStatusCollection property contains some of the basic status such as free, tentative, Out of Office or busy, based on its priority. You can specify the status of the ScheduleAppointment using this collection property. And also you can add new status to this existing collection, so that it will be displayed in editor.

{% highlight c# %}

        SfSchedule schedule = new SfSchedule();
            schedule.ScheduleType = ScheduleType.Week;
            schedule.AppointmentStatusCollection.Add(new ScheduleAppointmentStatus()
            {
                Status = "Idle",
                Brush = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Pink)
            });
            schedule.AppointmentStatusCollection.Add(new ScheduleAppointmentStatus()
            {
                Status = "Do not disturb",
                Brush = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Red)
            });
            this.grid.Children.Add(schedule);
