# Input Validation

The ValidationMode property is used to update the Value property when a key is pressed or focus is lost. ValidationMode includes the following options:

* KeyPress
* LostFocus

When the ValidationMode is KeyPress, the value is changed for each key press. When ValidationMode is LostFocus, the value is changed only when the control is no longer focused on the text box.
