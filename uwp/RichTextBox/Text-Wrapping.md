# Text Wrapping in UWP RichTextBox (SfRichTextBoxAdv)
Text wrapping refers to how images and shapes are positioned about to text in a document. Currently, SfRichTextBoxAdv has only preservation support for image and textbox shape with below wrapping styles. The image can be inserted with inline wrapping style alone.

## In-Line with Text
This option places an image on the same line as the surrounding text. The image will thus move as text is added or removed, whereas the other options here mean the image stays in one position while the text shifts and wraps around it.

## Behind
Places an image behind the text, allowing you to add like watermark or background image on a page.

## In Front of Text
Places the picture in front of the text. This can be used to place an image around some text or to add shape to highlight the part of a passage.

N> In front of and behind text wrapping styles are supported from version 18.3.0. X.

## Top and Bottom
Text wraps above and below the image so it is on its line. This is most useful for larger images that occupy most of the width of a page.

N> Top and bottom wrapping style is supported from the version 19.1.0. X.

## Square
This wraps text around an image on all sides at right angles, as if it had a rectangular box around it.

N> Tight and Through types are also displayed as Square wrapping style in SfRichTextBoxAdv. And it is supported from version 19.2.0. X.
