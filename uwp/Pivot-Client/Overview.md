# Overview

The SfPivotClient control supports browsing multidimensional data that is organized in the form of dimensions, measures, named sets, and KPIs in a cube format. You can visualize the results in graphical (pivot chart) and tabular (pivot grid) formats. The control can also be used to create and edit reports on-the-fly that are stored for later use.
