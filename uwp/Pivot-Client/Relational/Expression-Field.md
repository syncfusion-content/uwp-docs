# Expression Fields in UWP Pivot Client (SfPivotClient)

The SfPivotClient supports adding expression field at runtime by using the expression field dialog.

**Adding an expression field**

1. To add a new expression field, click **Expression Field** ![](Expression-field_images/Expression-field-icon.png) in the client toolbar. The expression field dialog opens.

2. Define the **Field Name** for the expression field.

3. You can define the expression based on the existing calculation items and numerical operators using the **Expression** field.

4. You can define the format for the required field by using the **Format String** field. For example, 'C' for Currency, 'P' for Percentage, and 'N' for Numeric.

5. You can change the summary type value by using the **Summary Type** drop-down. The default value of summary type is 'Count'.
