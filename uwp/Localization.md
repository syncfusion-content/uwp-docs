# Localization of Syncfusion UWP controls

Localization is the process of translating the application resources into different language for the specific cultures. You can localize the syncfusion UWP controls by adding resource file for each language.

## Changing application culture

When you are changing the application culture, then you can localize the application based on application culture by creating .resw file.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

public sealed partial class MainPage
{
    public MainPage()
    {
        CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo("de");
        this.InitializeComponent();
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight VB %}

Public NotInheritable Partial Class MainPage
	Public Sub New()
		CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture = New CultureInfo("de")
		Me.InitializeComponent()
	End Sub
End Class

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

## Creating .resw files

You can create .resw files for any language by following steps,

N> You can get the default resource files of all Syncfusion UWP libraries from [GitHub](https://github.com/syncfusion/uwp-controls-localization-resource-files).

1) Right click your project and add new folder named `Resources`.

2) Add [default resource files](https://github.com/syncfusion/uwp-controls-localization-resource-files) of libraries you are using into `Resources` folder.

N> Consider you are using `SfDataGrid` control in your application. Then you need to copy and include `Syncfusion.SfGrid.UWP.Resources.resw` (since `SfDataGrid` present in `Syncfusion.SfGrid.UWP` library) file in your application under `Resources` folder. So, now you can know the key names and values of default strings used in `Syncfusion.SfGrid.UWP.dll` library.

3) Now, right click `Resources` folder and select `Add` and then `New Item`. In `Add New Item` wizard, select the Resources File option and name the file name as `Syncfusion.SfGrid.UWP.Resources.<culture name>.resw`. For example, you have to give name as `Syncfusion.SfDataGrid.UWP.Resources.de.resw` for `German` culture. In the same way, add new resource files for other libraries used in your application.

4) Now, select `Add` and add resource file for German culture in `Resources` folder.

5) Now, you can  copy the key names and from default resource files and assign value based on the culture, the resource file targets.

## Editing default culture strings

You can change the default string of any control by adding the default .resw files ([from GitHub](https://github.com/syncfusion/uwp-controls-localization-resource-files)) to `Resources` folder of your application. Syncfusion UWP controls reads the default string from the .resw files of application if its added.
