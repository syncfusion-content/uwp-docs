# Deployment

## Copy Local

Copying assemblies to local folder is supported by Syncfusion components. It can be achieved by setting the assemblyâ€™s Copy Local property to true, so that it can be copied to Bin\Release, Bin\Debug folders. The files .exe, .dll, .xml, .pri, rd.xml, .xaml  are copied to client machines.
