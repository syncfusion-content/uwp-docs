# Deployment

## Copy Local

Copying assemblies to local folder is supported by Syncfusion&reg; components. It can be achieved by setting the assembly’s Copy Local property to true, so that it can be copied to Bin\Release, Bin\Debug folders. The files .exe, .dll, .xml, .pri, rd.xml, .xaml  are copied to client machines.
