# Selection and Editing

This section explains about the Selection and Editing behavior in SfSpreadsheet

## Selection

The SfSpreadsheet control provides support for selection in grid by using mouse, keyboard and touch interactions.

By default, Selection behavior will be enabled in SfSpreadsheet,but if you want to disable the selection in SfSpreadsheet, then set the `AllowSelection` Property to be false.

{% highlight c# %}

void spreadsheet_WorkbookLoaded(object sender, WorkbookLoadedEventArgs args)
{
    spreadsheet.ActiveGrid.AllowSelection = false;
}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

The Events associated with the Selection behavior are

* `SelectionChanging`     â€“ Occurs when the selection is going to be changed. This event allows to cancel the selection change.
* `SelectionChanged`      - Occurs after the selection is changed
* `CurrentCellActivating` - Occurs when the current cell is going to be activated. This event allow to cancel the current cell activation.

   {
      grid.CurrentCellBeginEdit += grid_CurrentCellBeginEdit;

      grid.CurrentCellEndEdit += grid_CurrentCellEndEdit;
